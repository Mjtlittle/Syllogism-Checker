# Syllogism Validity Checker

A simple tool to check the validity of categorical three statement syllogisms. This was made for fun, based of my intro to logic class. There are still some missing explanations but I plan on fleshing that out in the future.

## Todo
- Give the equal negatives test an explanation
- Switch the statement distributed value to be a set instead of an array, such that I can use `.has()` and `.forEach()`
