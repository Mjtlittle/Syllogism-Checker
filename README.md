# Syllogism Validity Checker

A simple tool to check the validity of categorical three statement syllogisms. This was made for fun, based off topics discussed in my intro to logic class.

## Todo
- Give the equal negatives test an explanation
- Switch the statement distributed value to be a set instead of an array, such that I can use `.has()` and `.forEach()`
